Admittedly, the diversity of lightning applications is an enrichment
world of Salesforce extensions, where everything goes through these applications
to facilitate tasks, bring more comfort, and gain in
time and money.\\
The objective of this report is to present the application carried out
during our end of studies internship project within the company TechLead. Our application facilitates the task of managing the members of Salesforce communities for community managers and administrators. The app
carried out also integrates a smart Salesforce digital assistant and a synthetic dashboard for community directors.\\
This internship allowed us to improve our technical Salesforce knowledge given
that we used a variety of technologies associated with said platform.
On the other hand, during this
internship, we got used to professional life and teamwork as well as time management regarding software development.
To conclude, our realized application can be extended by further improving the Chatbot feature, as well as adding an event notification system.
It is also possible to make our application multilingual in future updates.
