Admittedly, the diversity of mobile applications is an enrichment
world of mobility, and social life, where everything goes through these applications
to facilitate daily tasks and bring more comfort, gain in
time and money.\\
The objective of this report is to present the application carried out
during our summer internship project within the company Glocal IT.
Our application allows customers to track specific companies by receiving notifications about them and consulting deep details about them. The app
carried out also integrates a document marketplace where customers can purchase specific company documents and download them to their local storage.\\
This internship allowed us to improve our technical knowledge given
that we used a variety of technologies.
On the other hand, during this
internship, we got used to professional life and teamwork.
To conclude, our realized application can be extended by developing
payment functionality planned in the design, as well as the notification system.
It is also possible to make our application multilingual.
