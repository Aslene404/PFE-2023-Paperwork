\chapter{Conception}
\section*{Introduction}
After identifying the functional and non-functional needs and the main functionalities of our application. We begin this part
of the conceptual study by describing the general architecture of our system and
it's detailed internal modeling through class and sequence diagrams.
\section{Global Architecture}
In this section, we will give an overview of the definition of the
the architectural pattern was chosen to model our application and we will
detail the projection of this pattern on our application.

\subsection{Definition of the Model-View-Controller design pattern}
Our chosen architecture of work for this project will be the MVC  architecture since it is recommended by the Salesforce developer’s community.\\
The model-view-controller (MVC) design pattern specifies that an application consists of a data model, presentation information, and control information.\cite{5} \\
The pattern requires that each of these be separated into different objects:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{The model} (for example, the data information) contains only pure application data; it contains no logic describing how to present the data to a user. \cite{5}
\item \textbf{The view} (for example, the presentation information) presents the model's data to the user. The view knows how to access the model's data but does not know what this data means or what the user can do to manipulate it. \cite{5}
\item \textbf{The controller} (for example, the control information) exists between the view and the model. It listens to events triggered by the view (or another external source) and executes the appropriate reaction to these events. In most cases, the reaction is to call a method on the model. Since the view and the model are connected through a notification mechanism, the result of this action is then automatically reflected in the view.\cite{5}
\end{itemize}
Thanks to these principles, the components of the application become easy to
manage, test, modify, and reuse.\\
The following figure explains furthermore the role and the idea behind each component of the MVC pattern:

\subsection{Application of the "MVC" pattern}
We explain in this paragraph the details of the projection of the pattern
MVC on our app.\\
The following figure represents the class diagram which illustrates the binding
between entities (classes). Indeed, this diagram translates the content of the \textbf{Model} component, and it's based on the schema that is already established within the Salesforce infrastructure.

The classes we have defined in the "Entities" layer are related to the German business field, employable in various types of commercial applications, and
independent of our application. Thus, we made the
principle of independence between the business rules and the application rules.\\
For the rest of the layers of the Clean architecture pattern, we will describe
the dependencies between these layers by giving an example of a connection between a
set of classes belonging to these layers.
The following figure represents the general dependence in our case between the
layers of the clean architecture pattern.
\begin{figure}[H]%
    \center   
    \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{ca_dep.png}
    \caption{General dependency diagram}
\end{figure}
\begin{itemize}
\item The domain layer (Entities) is independent of all layers.
\item The application layer (Usecase) depends on the domain layer and is independent of other layers. This layer prepares responses to
user queries using entities.
\item The adapters interface layer depends on the application(Usecase) layer.
This layer transmits the user request and the necessary data
to its processing at the Use Cases layer and retrieves the response and structure
for the User Interface component.
\item The user interface (UI) component of the "External technologies" layer
depends on the interface layer adapters through the Presenter an n
pass the user's request to it and retrieves the response.
\item The database component of the "External technologies" layer
allows the Use Case layer to retrieve data through a
Gateway(Repository) belonging to the Interface Adapter layer.

\end{itemize}
The following figure shows an example of a detailed dependency between
layers of the clean architecture pattern in the case of our application. These dependencies link a set of classes belonging to the different layers.
These classes realize the example of the functionality of displaying the list of
users.
\begin{figure}[H]%
    \center   
    \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{ca_dep_detail.png}
    \caption{Detailed dependency diagram in case of functionality
print the list of users}
\end{figure}
According to the figure, the Interface Adapter layer (UserPresenter and UserRepository)
communicates (passing and retrieving data) with the Use layer
boxes by implementing or instantiating its IGetListUser and IUser-
Repository. These interfaces represent the "ports" of the Use Cases layer.
This example shows how we realized the principle of independence
from the core of the application of the technologies used. No instance of the
adapters interface layer or outer layer exists in the app's core.
\section{Dynamic view of the application}
In this section, we will describe the internal dynamic of our application using sequence diagrams and activity diagrams
\subsection{Detailed sequence diagram of the "register" use case}
The following figure illustrates the detailed sequence diagram of the use case
"Register".
This use case starts with opening a registration interface
for the user. Then, the user enters his coordinates and confirms them.
The system displays an error message if the email already exists otherwise it redirects
the user to the home page. 
\begin{figure}[H]%
    \center   
    \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{seq_r.png}
    \caption{Detailed sequence diagram of the "register" use case}
\end{figure}
\subsection{Detailed sequence diagram of the "login" use case}
The following figure illustrates the detailed sequence diagram of the use case
"login".
This use case starts with opening a login interface
for the user. Then, the user enters his email and password then confirms them.
The system displays an error message if the email or the password is incorrect otherwise it redirects
the user to the home page.
the user may also choose to log in using a social media account ( Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, Xing), by taping the dedicated button to each social media which will redirect him to the interface provided by that specific social media API, the user will be redirected to the home interface upon successful social media login.

\end{figure}
\subsection{Detailed sequence diagram of the "search company" use case}
The following figure illustrates the detailed sequence diagram of the use case
"search company".
This use case starts with opening an interface for the company's search for the user. Then the user enters the name of the wanted company's name or the first letters of its name, he may also add some filter to the results using a different interface (by state, zip code, legal form, capital, branch), upon confirming his request the interface will prompt an interactive list of results where the user may tap one of them to access more detailed information about it.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Detailed sequence diagram of the "follow company" use case}
The following figure illustrates the detailed sequence diagram of the use case
"follow company".
This use case starts with opening an interface containing specific company details for the user. Then the user may tap the follow button to add that company to his tracked companies list and start receiving notifications about it, these notifications may be deactivated later in the tracked companies interface.

\end{figure}
\subsection{Detailed sequence diagram of the "purchase documents" use case}
The following figure illustrates the detailed sequence diagram of the use case
"purchase documents".
This use case starts with opening an interface containing specific company details for the user. Then the user may scroll down to the documents section and add wanted documents to his cart, after that he may checkout and finalize his purchase process after filling in his credit card details. As a result, the purchased documents are added to the user's inventory interface and he may download them.

\section*{Conclusion}
This chapter presents one of the most important phases of the process of
development of a project: design subdivided into the overall design
and detailed design.\\
We presented a Clean Architecture architecture pattern and we
explained its application in our case. We have described the dynamic view
of the system through a set of sequence diagrams and diagrams
of activities.\\
The following chapter will deal with the realization of the project illustrated by screenshots of different interfaces. We will describe the environment of
work and the tools used too.
