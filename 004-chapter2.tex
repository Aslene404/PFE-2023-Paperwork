\chapter{Specification of needs}
\section*{Introduction}
In this chapter, we will identify the actors, then we will specify the functional and non-functional needs that the proposed solution must meet. Finally, we present the use case diagrams explaining our application's main functionalities.
\section{Identification of actors}
An actor represents an external entity that interacts directly with the
system. It can be either a human person or a system. We distinguish
two types of actors, the main actor, and a secondary actor. Indeed,
a principal actor obtains an observable result of the system while a
secondary actor is asked for additional information.\\
\subsection*{Main actors}
\textbf{Community Manager}\\
The community manager is the first main user of our application who should be able to :
\begin{itemize}
\item[•] Choose the community that he has the right to access and manage.
\item[•] Consult users of a specific community inside a well-organized table with pagination options.
\item[•] Filter said users by name, user-name, Salesforce account name, status (active or not active), and Salesforce profile.
\item[•] Consult and update the details of each user.
\item[•] Activate users within a specific community.
\item[•] Deactivate users within a specific community.
\item[•] Send a "Welcome to community" email to a specific active user.
\item[•] Send a "Reset password" email to a specific active user.
\item[•] Add one or multiple users at once to a specific community.
\end{itemize}
In case when the community manager has a Salesforce role he will be also able to :
\begin{itemize}
\item[•] Add one or multiple users at once to a specific community.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Salesforce Administrator}\\
The Salesforce administrator is the second main user of our application who should be able to :
\begin{itemize}
\item[•] Perform all the actions, mentioned above, that the community manager can.
\item[•] Consult a bar chart that shows the number of logins of each user within the selected community.
\item[•] Filter chart results by the period between two specific dates.
\item[•] Consult details about each user displayed in the chart.
\item[•] Update the Salesforce user license for each user displayed in the chart.
\item[•] Consult users failed login attempts to a specific community inside a well-organized table with pagination options.
\item[•] Filter said login attempts by name, user-name, status( Invalid password, No community access, etc... ) and event date and time.
\item[•] Consult detailed information about each login attempt.
\item[•] Send a security warning email to the account owner about the login attempt event.
\item[•] Access a Chatbot that provides information about the selected community or the Salesforce organization.


\end{itemize}
\subsection*{Secondary actors}
\textbf{Salesforce System}\\
This actor is the system, previously developed and deployed in a cloud server by the Salesforce organization, interactable through our application, and it's responsible for :
\begin{itemize}
\item[•] Sending an automatic "Welcome to community" email upon adding a new member to the community by our application user.  
\item[•] Sending an automatic "Welcome to community" email upon activating a previously deactivated user by our application user.
\item[•] Generating reset password URL upon sending a "Reset password" email to a community member by our application user.
\item[•] Tracking users' successful and failed login attempts and saving them to the organization database.

\end{itemize}
\section{Functional Needs}
Functional needs are expressed by the user of the application
which makes it possible to identify the functionalities of this application.\\
In our
case, the functional needs are:
\begin{itemize}
\item Choice of the community:\\
Select the community to which we will manage the users.

\item Manage users:\\
The system must allow users to be managed with the functionalities of activation,
deactivation, modification, and consultation of the list of users via a data table.
Creation of different filters that allow us to facilitate the navigation of the list of users.

\item Manage connection history:\\
Create a chart that shows the number of user connections per day, week, year, or
according to a well-determined date. This allows the administrator to modify the user’s license.


\item Offer a synthetic dashboard:\\
Allowing the system administrator / the community manager to visualize the KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) of his organization/community.


\end{itemize}
\section{Non-functional Needs}
Non-functional requirements represent the characteristics of the system.
They relate to the constraints to be taken into consideration to set up
an adequate solution.\\
For our application, the non-functional requirements are:
\begin{itemize}
\item Security:\\
Access to information is only possible after verification of privileges and access rights,
for example Authentication, Redirections.

\item Ergonomics and user-friendliness:\\
The application will provide a user-friendly and easy-to-use interface that does not
require any prerequisites, so it can be used by all types of users (even non-computer specialists).

\item Extensibility and maintainability:\\
The architecture of the application will allow the evolution and maintenance (addition
or deletion or update) at the level of its various modules in a flexible manner.

\item Performance:\\
The application must be efficient, i.e. the system must react within a period that does
not exceed 5 seconds, whatever the action of the application.

\item Availability:\\
The application will be available on 24/24 and 7/7 except during maintenance.

\end{itemize}
\section{Use case diagrams}
In this section, we will highlight the system's functionalities to be
from the functional needs mentioned above based on the UML(Unified Modeling Language) diagrams which group together all the system's use cases.
\subsection{Global use case diagram}
The following figure illustrates the global use case diagram of our application

\subsection{Use case refinement}
In this section, we will detail the main use cases.
\subsubsection{Consult user list use case refinement}
In our application, the community manager and the system administrator can access a data table containing the full list of users within their respective communities.\\
The following figure shows the Consult user list use case diagram.

\section*{Conclusion}
In this chapter, we have described the specification phases of the
needs of our developed application to identify the different actors
as well as the features and services that our application must provide.\\
We have detailed these features with use case diagrams. The next chapter will be devoted to the conception phase.
